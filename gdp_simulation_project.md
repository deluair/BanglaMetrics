# BanglaMetrics: Bangladesh GDP Calculation Reality Simulation Project

## Project Overview

**BanglaMetrics** is a comprehensive economic simulation platform that models the complex realities of GDP calculation in Bangladesh from 2005-2025, replicating the authentic challenges faced by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) in measuring national economic output. This project simulates Bangladesh's unique economic structure, incorporating the dominance of ready-made garments (RMG), massive remittance flows, rapid digital financial service adoption, significant informal economy, and climate vulnerability impacts on economic measurement.

## Bangladesh Economic Context

### Current Economic Profile (2024-25)
**GDP Structure**: $55.5 billion BDT (2024-25p), Per capita income: $2,820 USD, GDP growth rate: 3.97%
**Sectoral Composition**: Services 53%, Industry 32% (with textiles accounting for 57% of manufacturing), Agriculture 15%
**Export Dependence**: RMG exports constitute 80%+ of total exports, earning $50 billion in 2024
**Remittance Economy**: $22.1 billion annually (7th highest globally), representing 7.74% of GDP on average

### Key Economic Characteristics
**Ready-Made Garments Sector Dominance**
- Employs 4 million workers (85% rural women), accounts for 82% of merchandise exports
- Bangladesh has highest share of textiles in manufacturing value-added globally (>50% vs. 20% global average)
- Complex global value chains with high import content for inputs
- Heavy concentration in traditional markets (EU, US, UK) creating vulnerability

**Digital Financial Revolution**
- 240 million registered MFS accounts across 13 operators, dominated by bKash (60% market share), Nagad, and Rocket
- Government cash aid distribution through bKash during COVID-19 accelerated adoption
- Rapid transition from cash economy, enabling formalization tracking

**Informal Economy Challenges**
- Estimated 27.2% of GDP in informal activities
- Complex interdependencies: "95% of Bangladesh economy depends on RMG" through indirect linkages
- Traditional Hundi remittance systems competing with formal channels

**Climate Vulnerability Impact**
- Average tropical cyclone costs $1 billion annually, potential 9% GDP loss in severe flooding
- By 2050, one-third of agricultural GDP may be lost to climate impacts
- Annual displacement of populations affecting economic measurement

## Methodological Framework

### Core GDP Calculation Approaches (BBS Methods)

**Production Approach Implementation**
- Replicates BBS quarterly GDP release methodology with provisional and final estimates
- Models value-added calculations across Bangladesh's specific sectors:
  - **RMG Manufacturing**: Complex input-output tracking with imported fabric/accessories
  - **Agriculture**: Seasonal rice production with monsoon dependency and climate shocks
  - **Services**: Including traditional banking, MFS, and informal transport
  - **Construction**: Infrastructure development amid frequent climate damage

**Expenditure Approach Realism**
- **Consumption Patterns**: Urban-rural differential with MFS-tracked digital payments
- **Investment Tracking**: Government infrastructure spending vs. private RMG factory investment
- **Net Exports**: RMG export concentration vs. diverse import needs (fuel, machinery, food)
- **Government Expenditure**: Climate adaptation spending, subsidy programs

**Income Approach Complexities**
- **Labor Income**: RMG worker wages, agricultural seasonal work, informal sector earnings
- **Operating Surplus**: Profit sharing in family enterprises, RMG factory margins
- **Mixed Income**: Small trader profits, street vendor earnings, rural non-farm activities
